# Day-14-Higher-or-Lower

Hey there, let me introduce you to a cool game I've put together called "Higher or Lower." I used some neat coding techniques to make this happen, including creating functions to keep things organized and smooth. The game itself relies on a list of dictionaries that I've filled with interesting account details.

Now, I didn't want to bore you with the same accounts popping up, so I made sure to handle that. If you're wondering how, well, I created a function that removes an account once it's been used. That way, you won't see the same account twice by mistake.

Hope you have a blast playing the game! If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to share. Enjoy!
